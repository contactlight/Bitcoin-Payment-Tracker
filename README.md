Bitcoin-Payment-Tracker
=======================

A simple to setup and robust Bitcoin Payment Tracker that connects to a local or remote 'bitcoind' instance in order to manage incoming transactions and balances.

It is intended for developers who want to use bitcoind on their website to accept payments instead of relying on services such as BlockNotify.

It is currently in very early stage development and should not be used for anything on the production network.
